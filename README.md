# Haskell Excercises from Purely Functional Data Structures

A project to help me complete excercises from the book [Purely Functional Data
Structures by Chris
Okasaki](http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504).
Solutions are my own, though the excercises belong to the author and publisher.

## Why?

I'm doing these solutions because practice makes perfect. This is practice with
git, practice with tests, practice with haskell, and of course practice with the
source material.

I'm sharing them because, honestly, why not? I don't expect them to be useful to
others, but who knows.
